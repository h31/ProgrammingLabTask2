Kotlin is a statically typed programming Language that
runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled
to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure.
Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains programmers based in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
 While the syntax is not compatible with Java, kotlin
 is designed to interoperate with Java CODE

  and is reliant on Java code from the existing
  Java Class Library, such as the collections framework.
  Kotlin uses aggressive type inference to determine the type of values and expressions for which type
   has been left unstated. This reduces language verbosity relative to Java, which demands often entirely
   redundant type specifications.

As of Android Studio 3.0 (October 2017)
Kotlin is a fully supported programming language by Google
 on the Android Operating System,
  and is directly included in the Android Studio 3.0 IDE package as
  an alternative to the standard Java compiler.
   The Android kotlin compiler lets the user choose between
  targeting Java 6- or Java 8-compatible bytecode.
